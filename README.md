### Why Rust?
I’m done with Unity! The code was a mess and not scalable, so I took a hard turn into Rust. This allows me to have complete control over the game’s performance while also embracing Rust’s memory safety—which is especially handy for complex, turn-based mechanics.

I believe in open-source software and want full control over my game engine. Plus, there’s something deeply satisfying about low-level programming without unnecessary abstractions.
